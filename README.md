# Medster-frontend

The idea behind Medster was adding a tech stack to oneâ€™s OPD health insurance policy. Such a Tech stack would enable customers to have paperless easier/faster claim filings and obtaining settlements from their insurers. It would also help insurers reduce auditing costs and increase fraud detection measures.
Tech stack included React, MongoDB, Express, Bootstrap for development, Figma for design.
